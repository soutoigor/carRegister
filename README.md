# carRegister

This project was made for the course **Javascript Ninja**. In this project we needed to use AJAX to
**register, list, and delete** the cars, from a server that was created by **Fernando Daciuk** (teacher of the course).
Only the verification of repeated plates was made by me in the server.


## Installing
Clone the repository to your computer, then, in the folder **Server**, do a **npm install** to install the dependencies.
In that same folder, do the **node app.js**, to run the server.
Open the **index.html** with a server too, now you can use the application. :)
